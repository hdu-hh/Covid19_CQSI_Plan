# Covid-19 Controlled Quarantined Self-Immunization Plan

## Synopsis

Volunteers with low risk factors should get facilities to self-immunize in a controlled and quarantined environment.

## Axioms

- people with proven immunity are the most valuable resource in this pandemic

## Current Status

- there is no vaccination yet
- there is no reliable test on antibodies yet
- the risk factors of the infection are known
- most infected don't know of their infection at least for some days
- un-quarantined infections drive this epidemic
- the test coverage of infection candidates is currently way below 100%
- these candidates are often sent into home-quarantine

## No Reliable Self-Immunization Test Available Yet

The only way to prove self-immunization is currently when all of these points are true.

* infected contact and typical symptoms
* positive test for Covid-19 infection
* negative test for Covid-19 infection a few days later

## Certain Infection, Controlled Quarantine

- best effort to ensure infection
- medical supervision by "embedded scientists"

## No "Measle Party"

The difference to a "measle party" is

- there is no vaccination against CoVid-19 yet
- medical pre-examination of the risk factors
- informed voluntary decision
- check for motivation and quarantine-ability
- strict quarantine under medical supervision with monitoring
- a proven-immunization status after quarantine

## Volunteer Groups

- already infected
- low-risk candidates
  - with probable self-immunization

## Herd-Immunization

The virus is very infectious and already so wide-spread that experts agree, that at least 70% of the population will be infected until **"herd immunization" will stop the infection rate**.

### Alternatives

If herd-immunization is currently the only way to stop Covid-19 from doing more harm then the current alternatives have to be evaluated

#### Uncontrolled Spreading

- high risk people suffer severely
- the health system may be overloaded
 - an overloaded health system is catastrophic
- the supply chain is impacted by sick leaves, etc.

#### Slowed Spreading ("Flattened Curve")

- fewer high risk people have to suffer
- the health system may stay within capacity
- the supply chain is severely impacted depending on the strictness of control measures
- without proven immunizations the spreading may easily reappear

#### Controlled Infection and Quarantine

- self-harm is taboo in most communities
- low-risk people may get infected that may not be infected
- immunization is proven
- high risk persons can be shielded by a proven immunized environment

#### Full Coverage Virus Test

Currently not available.

#### Full Coverage Antibody Test

Currently not available.

## Risk Factors

- high blood preasure
- heart conditions
- secondary infections
- lung diseases
- diabetes
- age
