# CQSI Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

## MDs are desperately needed for the non-induced infections already!

- there is a large number of infected MDs
  - most of them with feeble symptoms are sent into home quarantine
  - they are perfect candidates as "embedded scientists" in quarantine groups

- MDs with certified immunization are much more efficient
    - they have less concerns for self-preservation
    - they need less resources
  - they cannot infect uninfected patients

## What would MDs do in their quarantine groups?

- monitor feever, blood preasure, lung sounds, etc.
- recognize and fight secondary infections
- identify and address emergency situations
- evaluate indiviual symptoms vs risk factors and alert if mismatch
- mitigate symptoms
- address group stress issues
- monitor the recovery and self-immunization

## What would immunized MDs do for CQSI candidates?

- checking for risk factors
- informing of the risk
- vetoing high risk volunteers
- verifying the self-immunization

## What would immunized psychologists do for CQSI candidates?

- checking the motivation
- checking the fitness for strict quarantine in a group

## Why would anyone volunteer as CQSI candidate?

- most people will be infected anyway
  - conscious infection allows perfectly timed quarantine
  - perfect quarantine avoids spreading to loved ones and community
  - controlled and well-provided for quarantine

- certified immunization
  - allows helping where others would introduce risks
  - avoids eventually multiple "dry quarantines"
  - allows leading a "normal life"

## What are key requirements of CQSI candidates?

- low risk factors
- full conciousness to make the voluntary decision
- fitness for quarantine in a group

### Who should first get into controlled quarantine?

- infected persons that are fit for group quarantine

### Who should go next into controlled quarantine?

- high probability of existing immunization acquired with least symptoms

### And then?

- persons with lowest risk factors

## Are there other points for candidate priorization?

- persons who would use their certified immunization for the best
  - for avoiding new infections
  - for needing less resources to help
  - for stabilizing the supply chain

## Don't induced infection waste resources that are desperately needed elsewhere?

- certified immunized persons are the most valuable asset there in a pandemic
- induced infection and quarantined self-immunization is currently the only way increase the number of certified immunized persons

## Aren't vaccinations a much better alternative?

Yes of course. But only if they are available!

## When is it time to end the CQSI program?

- when a vaccination become available
- when reliable antibody tests become available and enough people are positive
- when no suitable candidates are left

## What tasks would be suitable for certified immune persons?

- protecting the supply chain from infection
  - at the sources
  - in the distribution chain
- nursing the sick
- providing for persons of the risk groups
- producing new resources and revenue

## Are you an MD? are you are virologist? Are you specialist on pandemics? Why are you wasting everbody's time if you are none of these?

- immunized persons are one of the most valuable resources in such a pandemic
- certified immunized persons are even more valuable resources
- currently these immunized persons are
  - are restricted by the same measures that restrict the general population
    - from helping others
    - from keeping up the supply chain
  - this is an obvious mis-allocation of resources
- getting the possibly critical role of immunized people into the discussion is worth every effort

## But immunized persons already have a valuable role in the "herd immunity" model?

- controlling the spread of immunity by "counter-infections"
  - protects the high risk persons
  - accelerates herd immunization
  - accelerates a general recovery
