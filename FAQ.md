# CQSI Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

## MDs are desperately needed for non-induced infections already!

- there already is a large number of infected MDs
  - most of them with light symptoms are sent into home quarantine
  - they would be perfect candidates as "embedded scientists" in quarantine groups

- MDs with certified immunization are much more efficient
  - they cannot infect uninfected patients
  - they have less concerns for self-preservation
  - they need less resources

## What would MDs do in their quarantine groups?

- monitor feever, blood preasure, lung sounds, etc.
- recognize and fight secondary infections
- identify and address emergency situations
- evaluate indiviual symptoms vs risk factors and alert if mismatch
- mitigate symptoms
- address group stress issues
- monitor the recovery and self-immunization

## What would immunized MDs do for CQSI candidates?

- check risk factors
- inform about the individual risk
- veto high risk volunteers
- double check the candidates' self-immunization

## What would immunized psychologists do for CQSI candidates?

- check the motivation
- check fitness for strict quarantine in a group

## Why would anyone volunteer as CQSI candidate?

- most people will be infected anyway
  - conscious infection allows perfectly timed quarantine
  - strict quarantine avoids spreading to loved ones and community
  - a controlled and well-provided for quarantine

- a certified immunization status
  - allows helping where others would introduce risks
  - avoids eventually multiple "dry quarantines"
  - allows leading a "normal life"

## What are key requirements of CQSI candidates?

- low risk factors
- full conciousness to make the voluntary decision
- fitness for strict quarantine in a group

### Who should first get into controlled quarantine?

- infected persons that are fit for group quarantine

### Who should go next into controlled quarantine?

- high probability of existing immunity acquired with least symptoms

### And then?

- persons with lowest risk factors

## Are there other points for candidate priorization?

- persons who would use their certified immunization for the best
  - for avoiding new infections
  - for needing less resources to help
  - for stabilizing the supply chain

## Wouldn't induced infection waste resources that are desperately needed elsewhere?

- "[back-burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn)" is a proven strategy for fighting [wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire)
- certified immunized persons are the most valuable asset there in a pandemic
- induced infection and quarantined self-immunization is currently the only way to increase the number of certified immunized persons

## Cured persons already have "proven immunity" in the current system, so what is the point of CQSI?

- **with CQSI the number of proven immunities would be higher by orders of magnitude**
- proven-immune persons would be employed to mimimize uncontrolled spreading
- many persons with few symptoms self-immunize outside the health system
  - but in countries with the highest infection rates
    - they are needed most
    - testing resource are scarce, so there is no proof of infection and immunization for people with light symptoms

## Aren't vaccinations a much better alternative?

Yes of course. But only if they are available!

## When is it time to end the CQSI program?

- when a vaccination become available
- when reliable antibody tests become available and enough people are positive
- when no suitable candidates are left

## What tasks would be suitable for certified immune persons?

- protecting the supply chain from infection
  - at the sources
  - in the distribution chain
- nursing the sick
- providing for persons of the risk groups
- producing new resources and revenue

## Are you an MD? are you are virologist? Are you specialist on pandemics? Why are you wasting everbody's time if you are none of these?

Minimizing the total pain of this pandemic is worth every effort.
The service of certified immunized persons in critical roles is essential:

- currently these immunized persons are restricted by the same measures that restrict the general population
  - from helping others
  - from keeping up the supply chain
- this is an obvious mis-allocation of resources

## But immunized persons already have a valuable role in the "herd immunity" model?

Controlling the spread of immunity by "counter-infections"

- protects the high risk persons
- accelerates herd immunization
- accelerates a general recovery

## This is all to abstract. Give me a concrete example!

Low risk people help high risk people by shopping for them:

- shopping helpers with unknown immunization status can get infected and then spread the virus
  - to their loved ones
  - to their community
  - on the wares they are handling
  - to other shopping helpers in the supermarket
  - to the persons they wanted to help

- immunized people don't have these issues
  - disinfected wares from immunized people are safe

## Even low-risk persons can get into serious health issues!

- since there is a high chance they'd get infected anyway
  - they'd run into these same issues
  - they'd get it in a probably unsupervised setting
  - unkown risk factors can best be identified in monitored quarantine
  - improved risk calculations reduces the incident rate even more
- for every low-risk person that runs into problems hundreds become certified immunized

## There is no full self-immunization because it wears off after a while!

- it buys time until a vaccine becomes available
- herd immunization is achieved faster

## "Proven-immunized" persons could be mis-classified!

CQSI is all about minimizing the total pain and maximizing the probability for achieving this goal. Even non-Dirac shaped probability distributions help to steer the problems to near optimal solutions.

## What would MDs do, if they have high risk factors?

The health system needs all the expert help it can get. MDs must be strictly protected. They could
- either treat only immunized patients
- or use extensive protection when treating other patients
  - but only if the resources for this extensive protection are not scarce

## What are the kown risk factors?

Currently these risk factors are known:

- high blood preasure
- heart conditions
- secondary infections
- lung diseases
- diabetes
- age
- ...
